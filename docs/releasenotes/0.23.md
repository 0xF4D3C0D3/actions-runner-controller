# BREAKING CHANGE : Workflow job webhooks require an explicit field set

Previously the webhook workflow job was set as the default if no `githubEvent` was set:

```yaml
  scaleUpTriggers:
  - githubEvent: {}
    duration: "30m"
```

You now need to set `workflowJob: {}` explicitly

```yaml
  scaleUpTriggers:
  - githubEvent:
      workflowJob: {}
    duration: "30m"
```

# BREAKING CHANGE : topologySpreadConstraints renamed to topologySpreadConstraint

Previously to use the pod `topologySpreadConstraint:` attribute in your runners you had to set `topologySpreadConstraints:` instead, this was a typo and has been corrected.

# BREAKING CHANGE : Default sync period is now 1 minute instead of 10 minutes

Since caching as been implemented the default sync period of 10 minutes is unnecessarily conservative and gives a poor out of the box user experience. If you need a 10 minute sync period ensure you explicitly set this value.

# BREAKING CHANGE : A metric is set by default

Previously is no metric was provided and you were using pull based scaling, `TotalNumberOfQueuedAndInProgressWorkflowRuns` was applied. No default is set now and the end user must always set this metric explicitly if they want to use it.
